<h2>jsloader</h2>

Javascript asynchronous loader
The loader is made as simplier as possible. The logic follows few rules that cannot be omitted in order to get maximum performance.
It consist in definition into script tag attributes of the global variable with which the loader class is instantiated, and the relative path to the first class to load.

Note that the class has to be named the same as filename.

<script src="src/loader.js" instance="your_global_variable" load="path_to/your_file_class_name"></script>
<br><br>
There are three primary methods which are used.
The first is loader setter method, that is mandatory, for including class into loader and it must be called in every file after the class definition.

your_global_variable.include = your_class_name

At that time the second method which is used first to emulate the class that is required and include it automaticaly into the loader so the include method is not necessary. The preload method is used in order to load and extend abstract classes into defined class. Altough with the preload method you can define more classes per file because it has a possibility to prototype the defined class which ensembles into the emulated class structure.

your_global_variable.preload()

The third method has to be called into class constructor before loaded classes are instantiated, in order to set your class properties.

your_global_variable.load()

The main rule is to not call the class which calls its caller in the constructor to avoid endless loop. If you have to use methods from the caller class then define them staticaly.

Please check the package for further examples of usage.
